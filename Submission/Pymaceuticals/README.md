Homework for Module 5 - Matplotlib

In this assignment, we were given raw data for Mouse_metadata and Study_results as Resource files.

With Jupiter Notebook and Matplotlib, I've created a python script, pymaceuticals_final, that merged the data sets, created a summary table, and produced charts to illustrate the data in various ways. I've included bar, pie, line, and scatter,plots.
